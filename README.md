## AWS Developer Workshop

This is a workshop to get developers started on AWS using the cloud native primitives. This workshop is designed as a self paced lab which incrementally increases in expertise

We will build a simple web app based on microservices using the 12 factor methodology, deploy it on the cloud and try some debug steps.

We will do this workshop in a pair programming mode. So find a buddy.

**Pre-requisite**

1. [Setup AWS account ](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
1. [SetUp Development Environment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)

The modules build on each other and are intended to be executed linearly.

## Theme B -  **Containerized application**

|Module| Description |
|--|--|
| [Getting Started with Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate](http://running-containers-on-aws-fargate.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/getting-started-with-amazon-ecs-using-aws-fargate.html) | Create a new Amazon ECS cluster using the AWS Management Console. At the end of this module, weâ€™ll have a new ECS cluster and supporting infrastructure such as a VPC and subnets and a small Hello World application running |

|[Containers - Blue-Green Deployment](https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-canary-blue-green-deployment)|Execute a canary deployment for Amazon EC2 Container Service. In order to provide an automated and safe method of migrating traffic from a blue deployment to a green one, this solution leverages Route53 weights to adjust the traffic flow from one ECS service to another.|
